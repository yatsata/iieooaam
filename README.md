# Is it Ðµven or odd as a microservice
    This project was inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=Re3rijPsGoY video created by an iconic developer
known all over the world. The decision for duplicating the idea was that the high life PC Master Race needs solution
for the one of the world's most critical issues - is SOMETHING even or odd but the used technology can't be so peasant
looking as JavaScript. That's why our team decided to choose a modern, refined, high performance and no boilerplate code
technology. The only possible solution was god's favorite language - Java. 
      Ladies, Gentleman and others we are proud to present you - Is it oven or odd as a microservice!
